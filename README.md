Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects over 16 million Americans and is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States behind heart disease, cancer, and accidental death. While COPD can result from various toxic inhalations or asthma, it is most commonly associated with cigarette smoking.


COPD severity is typically measured by a device called a spirometer. Patients forcefully exhale into the device and the volume of air exhaled is used as a measure for the severity of disease (less air exhaled  ⇒  worse disease). Data collected by the COPDGene research group includes spirometry data on thousands of research participants.


Spirometry measures in the dataset:

The forced expiratory volume (FEV1) is the volume of air exhaled in 1 second
The forced vital capacity (FVC) is the total volume of air exhaled after a full breath
FEV1_FVC_ratio is the ratio between FEV1 and FVC (smaller  ⇒  worse disease)
FEV1_phase2 is the FEV1 of research participants 5 years later

I did this project to analyze the relationship between FEV1 at follow-up FEV1_phase2 and other variables in the dataset.
